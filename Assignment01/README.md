<p>This project resembles a simple computer store where a user which has been created beforehand, in this example - "Gandalf The Brown", will be able to work and save up some money to be able to buy a computer.</p>

<p>The Work button will give the user +100 balance each time it is clicked. The user will then be able to bank that balance. Whenever the user has banked a certain amount it will later be able to get a loan. However, the loan may not be higher than double the Bank Balance. Furthermore, the user may not get another loan until the previous one has been repaid, fully.</p>

<p>The <strong>Repay Loan</strong> button will <u>only</u> be available once a loan is active. Once it is clicked, it will check the users personal balance (Not Bank Balance) to see if the value is enough to pay back the loan. If it is not it will ask the user to obtain more balance.</p>

<p>The third box from the left is the one representing a selection of computers with the specs below it. Whenever you select another computer, the specifications below it will also update.</p>

<p>Below these boxes shown above we have the "Buying section", here the user will be able to buy a computer based on the selection from the previous box. Just like the specification list, the information below will also update when selection another computer.</p>
